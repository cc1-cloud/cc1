<p>
	Farm creation form is divided into four steps analogous to VM creation:
</p>
<ul class="text-ul">
	<li>
		<strong>Image choice</strong>:
		You select one common image for all nodes and for head.
		That makes them start with the same configuration.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Hardware choice</strong>: 
		However, you can select diffrent template for head and for nodes,
		giving them diffrent computational power.
			<ul class="text-ul">
				<li>Head template</li>
				<li>Worker node template</li>
				<li>Number of worker nodes</li>
			</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Optional resources</strong>:
		It is recommended to attach disk volume to store data on it.
		This is only possible on stage of farm creation.
		You are not able to attach disk to already created farms.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Confirmation</strong>
	</li>
</ul>
