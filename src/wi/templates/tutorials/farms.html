	Farms are automaticaly created clusters of virtual machines with preconfigured batch system.
</p>
<p>
	The functionality to create the preconfigured farm of VMs is provided to perform large scale processing.
	The farm can be created with any VM image with contextualization installed. 
</p>
<p>Every farm consists of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a single head node (HN)</li>
	<li>a specified number of worker nodes (WNs)</li>
</ul>
<p>All are created with the same VM image.</p>
<p>
	The HN plays the role of NFS server and the batch system controller (if the batch system is installed). 
	No central authentication is required. 
	All users present on a base VM image appears as local users on HN and every WNs 
	since they are created from the same VM image. 
	They share the same /home directory exported from HN to all WNs.
</p>
<p>The farm is created in two main steps:</p>
<ul class="text-ul">
	<li>In the first automatic step paswordless access from the HN to WNs is enabled.</li>
	<li>In the second step configuration script is executed on HN to mount /home directory on all WNs.</li>
</ul>
<p>
